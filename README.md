# Emotion_Detection_Internship


# Introduction
This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of seven groups, using profound neural networks with convolution. This repository is bringing this research paper into effect. The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset which was released on the International Machine Learning Conference (ICML). This dataset consists of photos of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 scaled face with seven emotions-furious, disgusted, afraid, pleased, optimistic, sad and shocked.
